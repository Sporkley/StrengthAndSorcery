# Chapter 1 - Secret of the Inner Sanctum
### The World
The world or Varn is a microcosm of a variety of landscapes and climates.  The known world is surrounded on all sides by the Impossible Peaks - mountains so tall, steep, and perilous that none have ever reached the other side. King Alamar rules the land from his castle in the east, near the edge of the world.  Other Lords keep watch over their lands from four other castles. Lord Ironfist rules from Castle White Wolf near the Sea of Varn in the south.  Lords Inspectron and Hacker rule from Blackwind North and Blackwind South, respectively, keeping guard over the north and managing access to the Ancient Glacier and Dark Forest in the west. Castle Dragadune lies vacant amongst the desolation of the Invading Desert in the northeast.  Myths speak of a sixth castle hidden in the dangerous wilds of the Dark Forest.

Most of civilization resides in one of 5 towns.  Sorpigal lies at the center of the world, nestled snugly in the Pleasant Valley.  Portsmith occupies a peninsula of the Sea of Varn and is the gateway to the islands.  Algary is a pocket of solid ground amongst the haunted marshlands of the southeast.  The residents of Dusk fight to survive in the unrelenting desert of the north.  Erliquin is a wealthy mountain mining town in the west.

The world was once a safe place to travel and conduct trade, but since the *Night of the Burning Moon* all of VARN has become much more dangerous.  Demons, abhorrations, monsterous beasts, and even the dead roam the land.  The lords have hidden away in their castles and the people rarely travel beyod city walls.  Now is the time for heroes.
