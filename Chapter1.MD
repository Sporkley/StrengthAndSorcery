##### The Delivery
Your adventure begins at Sorpigal, in which your freshly recruited band of adventurers are informed that the city is not as safe as it appears. Evil lurks just beneath the surface in an ancient dungeon hidden below Sorpigal. A renowned member of the local wizards' guild has gone missing and the party has been tasked to find and rescue her. 

Optional Combat:  A group of ruffians marks the party as easy prey with their shiny new recruit gear.
