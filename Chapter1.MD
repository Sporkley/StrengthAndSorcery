## Fronts
### Sorpigal
#### Campaign
##### The Delivery
Your adventure begins at Sorpigal, in which your freshly recruited band of adventurers are informed that the city is not as safe as it appears. Evil lurks just beneath the surface in an ancient dungeon hidden below Sorpigal. A renowned member of the local wizards' guild has gone missing and the party has been tasked to find and rescue her. 

Optional Combat:  A group of ruffians marks the party as easy prey with their shiny new recruit gear: **4:3** [Bandits](http://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/monsters#TOC-Bandit) per party member, rounded up. 

#### Side Adventures
##### Exploring Sorpigal
Combat:  The party is sure to encounter the band of ruffians described above if they do not head straight to the dungeon.  Furthermore they have attacted the attention of the underworld leader whom they may have to track down and defeat at a later time.
Trap:  Down a forgotten alley lies a trap door to the dungeon below. A failed check to spot the trap, or intentionally triggering the trap, will drop the party down into a difficult situation.
